# yt-dlp CLI

## Disclaimer

_This utility **does not** include [khinsider.py](https://github.com/obskyr/khinsider) or [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)._

## Introduction

This is a simplistic CLI frontend that simplifies the downloading of whole albums from [khinsider.com](https://downloads.khinsider.com/game-soundtracks). Downloads will attempt lossless FLAC, if an album does not have the option it will fallback to MP3. When downloads are completed, the output folder is opened upon completion.

## Use

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/MrMendelli/khinsider.py-CLI/releases/latest) and extract to a desired location. It is not recommended to extract to a UAC-protected parent directory. Then Install Python 3, once khinsider.py and Python 3 are downloaded and installed, run the script and follow the menu.

## Issues

## Contributing

Feel free to submit a PR, but please comment code when doing so. This is for clarity as batch has a range of use syntax and limitations that are too vast to account for so some things may seem unclear on first glance.
